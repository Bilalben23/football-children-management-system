# Football Children's Management System  

This web application is designed to assist coaches in managing children who participate in a football program. The system helps register new children, track whether their subscription has been paid, and categorize them by their birth year for easy management. Additionally, it uses **Laravel Breeze** for user authentication and **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and modern UI design.

## Personal Introduction  

As a full-stack developer, I have always been passionate about building efficient and user-friendly systems that solve real-world problems. This project combines my knowledge of Laravel, front-end design, and database management to address the challenges faced by football coaches in managing their team members. My goal was to create a robust, scalable, and intuitive solution that simplifies everyday tasks for coaches and administrators.

## Problem Statement  

Managing children in football programs can be overwhelming for coaches. Traditional methods, such as using spreadsheets or paper records, are inefficient and prone to errors. Coaches often face the following challenges:  

- Difficulty in organizing children by age group or birth year.  
- Time-consuming manual processes for registering new children and generating identification cards.  
- Lack of a centralized system to track subscription payments and maintain important notes.  
- Challenges in generating quick reports or overviews of the children in the program.  

These inefficiencies hinder the smooth operation of football programs and detract from the focus on training and development.

## Objectives  

The primary objectives of the **Football Children's Management System** are:  

1. **Simplify Registration**: Provide an easy-to-use interface for registering children and automatically generate a unique CIN (Carte d'IdentitÃ© Nationale) for each child.  
2. **Categorize by Birth Year**: Dynamically group children based on their birth year, making it easier for coaches to manage different age groups.  
3. **Enhance Identification**: Generate **football child cards** for easy identification during training or events.  
4. **Streamline Note Management**: Allow coaches to add and manage important notes for each child.  
5. **Automate Reporting**: Enable coaches to generate detailed PDF reports for individual children or categorized groups.  
6. **Improve User Experience**: Design a responsive and visually appealing UI using **Tailwind CSS**.  
7. **Ensure Data Security**: Use Laravel Breeze for secure user authentication and role-based access.

## Features  

- **Child Registration**: Coaches can register children by adding their details, such as name, birthdate, parent phone number, and an automatically generated unique child CIN.  
- **Categorize by Birth Year**: Children are grouped dynamically based on their birth year, making it easy to manage different age groups without creating multiple tables for each category.  
- **Notes on Children**: Coaches can add notes to each child's profile to track any important information.  
- **Football Child Card**: Each child is automatically assigned a unique CIN, which is used to generate a football child card. The card can be printed or stored digitally and is used to identify the child easily, particularly when they are playing or attending events.  
- **Generate PDF Reports**: The system can generate reports for individual children or lists of children categorized by their birth year.  
- **Dashboard Overview**: Displays a summary of the total number of children, their registration status, and categorized groups by birth year.  
- **User Authentication**: The system uses **Laravel Breeze** to handle user authentication for coaches and administrators.  
- **Responsive UI**: Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
